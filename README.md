# hrZones
When connecting Garmin Connect to Zwift, you can't see the heart rate distribution in Garmin Connect for the uploaded workout.

This little tool analyzes a tcx file, exported from Garmin Connect for a given activity to show the heart rate distribution to a given hr zone mapping.

## Installation
You need ```node``` and ```npm```installed.
After cloning the repository run ```npm install```.

## Execution
Run ```node hrZones.js [options] <filename>```

See ```node hrZones.js --help```for further information.
